# Generic Algoritms and Data Structures

This is a project providing standalone, platform independent templatized implementations in C++ of common algorithms and data structures.
The project is handled by CMake and unit tests are organized with CTest.

To compile the code use CMake to generate a desired project or Makefile.
A typical build/run scenario on Linux would look like:

cmake .  
gmake  
gmake test  


The project currently contains following implementations:

### Data structures:
Binary heap  
Suffix array  

### Algoritmhs:
Partition Lomuto  
N-th smallest element  
Quick sort  
Merge sort  
Binary search  
Lower bound  
Upper bound  
Next lexicographic permutation  
Modular exponent  
Generate combinations  
Generate subsets  
Longest common subsequence  
Approximative string matching  
Partition range
